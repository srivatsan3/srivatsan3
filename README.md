# 👋 Hi, I'm Srivatsan

I'm an MSc Robotics student at the University of Manchester with two years of industry experience as a Data Scientist at Micron Technology. 
My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, simulation, and real-world engineering, where algorithms meet materials, control, and design.


🧪 **Featured Projects:**
-  **Leo Rover** – Integrated SLAM, Object Recognition and Manipulator over a Leo Rover System to perform a search and retrieval task
-  **VAE Scene Reconstruction** – Latent-space interpolation of driving scenes under weather conditions  
-  **Mechanical Optimization with GA** – Parameter tuning of spring-damper models using genetic algorithms 

📚 I'm passionate about applying AI to physical systems and building tools that accelerate real-world innovation.
