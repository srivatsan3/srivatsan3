# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Srivatsan

I'm an MSc Robotics student at the University of Manchester with two years of industry experience as a Data Scientist at Micron Technology. 
My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, simulation, and real-world engineering, where algorithms meet materials, control, and design.


ðŸ§ª **Featured Projects:**
-  **Wafer Defect Detection** â€“ Deep learning model to classify semiconductor defects using PyTorch and GCP  
-  **VAE Scene Reconstruction** â€“ Latent-space interpolation of driving scenes under weather conditions  
-  **Mechanical Optimization with GA** â€“ Parameter tuning of spring-damper models using genetic algorithms 

ðŸ“š I'm passionate about applying AI to physical systems and building tools that accelerate real-world innovation.
